# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code


Third-Party API's Challenge: Work Day Scheduler
 I made a daily planner to create a scheudle. When the planner is opend the current day is displayed at the top. You can see all my working hours and add important events or task. The tasked are saved in local storage.  The hours are color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future.
